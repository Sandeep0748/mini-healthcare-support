# Mini Healthcare Support Web App (React)

## Overview
This is a concept-level React web application designed for healthcare NGOs.
It demonstrates a basic support request form and a simulated AI chatbot for FAQs.

## Features
- Patient Support Request Form
- AI Chatbot Concept with automated FAQ responses
- Clean and simple UI

## Tech Stack
- React
- JavaScript (JSX)
- CSS

## AI / Automation Idea
The chatbot simulates an AI assistant by responding to common healthcare-related
questions using predefined logic. This helps reduce repetitive manual queries
handled by NGO volunteers.

## NGO Use-Case
Healthcare NGOs can use this application to:
- Collect patient support requests digitally
- Provide instant automated responses to common questions
- Improve accessibility and response efficiency

## Note
This project is created as a concept-level assignment.
The focus is on clarity, effort, and idea demonstration rather than full AI implementation.
